# Treatment impact on Tumor growth: Decision Support in the longitudinal setting

Recognizing the appropriate timing for administering treatments to patients and
determining the best choice among various treatment options over a period of time
pose significant medical challenges, with limited existing solutions available. In
this work, we benchmark several methods to determine the best treatment policy
on a synthetic cancer dataset. We include standard methods that do not take
into account the time-dependent confounding, as well as methods that adjust for
confounding effects. We evaluate both the patientâ€™s trajectory forecasting, as well
as the accuracy of the best treatment selection.
